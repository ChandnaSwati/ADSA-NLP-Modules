## Overview

This repository supports **Analytics 2: Text Mining and Natural Language Processing** course of the *Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence* master‚Äôs program, focusing on the **evolution of NLP ‚Äî from classical techniques to modern large language models and AI agents.**

It combines theory, implementation, and reflective exercises to help students:
- Understand model architectures and memory mechanisms  
- Build and fine-tune transformer models  
- Experiment with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines  
- Design multi-agent AI systems and real-world applications  

Each module includes:
- Lecture notebooks  
- Lab / Hands-on sessions  
- Visualization exercises  
- Mini-assignments and capstone projects

##  How to Use

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 1: Run in Google Colab
1. Click ‚ÄúOpen in Colab‚Äù above  
2. Enable GPU under *Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type*  
3. Run cells sequentially and record observations  
4. Save your version in Drive or export as `.ipynb`

### üíª Option 2: Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChandnaSwati/NLP.git
cd NLP/Module\\ 8
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib numpy scikit-learn torchtext jupyter
jupyter notebook



##  How to Use
1. By the end of the NLP sequence (Modules 8‚Äì12), students will:
2. Understand and implement sequence models (RNNs ‚Üí Transformers)
3. Fine-tune pretrained models for downstream tasks
4. Design retrieval-augmented systems
5. Develop intelligent multi-agent architectures
6. Reflect critically on model evolution and ethical use

## Contributions
You are welcome to:
1. Add new labs or datasets per module
2. Improve visualizations (attention maps, hidden states, embeddings)
3. Share extensions (RAG + Agents integration)
4. Submit pull requests to enhance course content
